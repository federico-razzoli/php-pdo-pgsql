# PHP PDO PgSQL

Docker image with PHP, PDO with PostgreSQL driver, and Apache web server.

## Project Goals

The goal is to have a stable, simple, reasonably lightweight, single-purpose PHP
image that is able to connect to PostgreSQL.

Using the mainstream PHP image is fine, to keep the maintenance efforts low.
The key is to support much less use cases, providing a ready-to-use tool.
Making the image lighter (in terms of size and footprint) is a nice-to-have.
